Gbook is simple application dedicated to synchronizing contacts between abook data file
and google contacts.

Right now it only support abook data file in default location (~/.abook/addressbook). This
will probably change.

1. Requirements

cmake
libcurl
libjsoncpp
gcc 4.8+ (c++11 support)

2. Settings & compilation & usage

Settings:

Google client id & secret are *compile-time* option, set correct values in include/oauth2.h.

Compile using:

    cmake
    make

Use:

    ./gbook

There are two options, -s (--synchronize), which is default. It just synces changes. Second is
-m (--manage), which for now just opens abook.
