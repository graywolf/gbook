0. Prolog

Gbook is simple application dedicated to synchronizing contacts between abook data file
and google contacts.



1. Requirements

cmake
libcurl
libjsoncpp
gcc 4.8+ (c++11 support) (clang not tested, should work too)



1.5 Checkout submodule

You need to checkout tinyxml2 submodule (if you didn't use git clone --recursive). You can use following command executed in root of git repository:

    git submodule update --init --recursive



2. Compilation

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make



3. Configuration

There's a file `config` in root folder, you should fill it (defaults are mostly
good, just set client_id, client_secret) and copy into ~/.config/gbook . You can
have config file even in other places but you need to specify path each time you
use this program.

Your credentials in Google Developers Console needs to be of type "Other".



4. Usage

See `./gbook --help` for possible options.



5. Logging

There are two loggers included.
1) cout logger
    logging into std::count

    Amount of output can be configured via command line arguments. See program
    help for more details.

2) file logger
    logging into std::ofstream(general.log_file)

    Logs always the most verbose output possible. Useful for post-mortem debugging
    after program dies with lower verbosity on cout logger.

    Can be turned out by leaving general.log_file in config file empty or delete it
    altogether.
