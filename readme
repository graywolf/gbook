Gbook is simple application dedicated to synchronizing contacts between abook data file
and google contacts.

1. Requirements

cmake
libcurl
libjsoncpp
libconfig
gcc 4.8+ (c++11 support)

2. Compilation

    cmake
    make

3. Configuration

There's a file `config` in root folder, you should fill it (defaults are mostly
good, just set client_id, client_secret) and copy into ~/.config/gbook . You can
have config file even in other places but you need to specify path each time you
use this program.

See `./gbook --help` for possible options.
